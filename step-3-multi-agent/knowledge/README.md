## After Making Changes

### Updating the AI System

After adding or modifying entries in either file:

1. **Save the file** with your changes
2. **Re-seed the database** by running:
   ```bash
   cd step-2-rag-integration
   ./setup.sh seed
   ```
3. **Test your changes** by asking the AI assistant questions related to your updates

### Testing Your Updates

Try asking questions that should match your new entries:

```bash
# Test FAQ updates
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Your new FAQ question here"}'

# Test business rule updates  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Question about your new business rule"}'
```

## Common Scenarios

### Updating Shipping Policies
When shipping policies change:
1. Update relevant entries in `business_rules.json`
2. Update related FAQ entries in `faq.json`
3. Re-seed the database
4. Test with questions like "What's your shipping policy?"

### Adding New Promotions
When running new promotions:
1. Add promotion details to `business_rules.json`
2. Add customer-facing FAQ if needed
3. Set `active: true` to enable, `active: false` to disable
4. Re-seed the database

### Seasonal Updates
For holiday policies or temporary changes:
1. Add entries with clear `effective_date` and end dates in description
2. Use `active: false` to disable expired promotions
3. Update regularly to keep information current
