🗑️ DEPRECATED (moved to deprecated/):

## 🧠 **Strategy Engine - Your Key Feature**

### **Business Strategies (Text-Based):**
```json
{
  "strategies": [
    {
      "name": "Cancel and Reorder with Gift Card",
      "conditions": [
        "Direct address change not possible",
        "Order has been shipped or is outside change window"
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Cancel the existing order",
        "Issue gift card for the full order amount",
        "Create new order with desired delivery address", 
        "Apply gift card as payment method"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Your Exact Use Case Now Works:**
> **"If address change required, cancel the order with a gift card and use gift card to make new order with desired address"**

This is now handled **automatically** by the strategy engine, with **zero code changes** required to add new business strategies!

## 📊 **Metrics & Benefits**

### **Complexity Reduction:**
- **Before:** 6 agents (CustomerAgent + ProductAgent + OrderAgent + ShippingAgent + RulesAgent + AgentOrchestrator)
- **After:** 3 agents (UnifiedBusinessAgent + RulesAgent + DynamicOrchestrator)
- **Reduction:** 50% fewer agents to maintain

### **Functionality Preservation:**
- ✅ All 20+ business operations still work
- ✅ Enhanced address handling (Oak Street Tree Apartment)
- ✅ Smart address completion and validation
- ✅ Complete order lifecycle management
- ✅ RAG integration for business rules

### **Performance Improvements:**
- ✅ Fewer inter-agent communication calls
- ✅ Simplified workflow execution
- ✅ Faster response times
- ✅ Cleaner error handling and debugging

## 🎯 **Test Queries to Verify Success**

### **1. Your Main Use Case:**
```
"I want to change my delivery address but my iPhone 15 Pro order was already shipped. Can you change it to Oak Street Tree Apartment?"
```
**Expected:** Strategy engine selects "Cancel and Reorder with Gift Card"

### **2. Smart Address Completion:**
```
"Place order for iPhone 15 Pro to Oak Street Tree Apartment address, possible to get in 2 days?"
```
**Expected:** Intelligent address extraction and completion

### **3. Standard Business Operations:**
```
"I want to buy an iPhone 15 Pro with express shipping to my home address"
```
**Expected:** Complete unified business agent workflow

## 🔧 **How to Start Testing**

### **Option 1: Quick Architecture Test**
```bash
python3 test_architecture.py
```
**Result:** ✅ All components verified working

### **Option 2: Start Full Server** 
```bash
./setup.sh start
```
Then use the test queries above

### **Option 3: Manual Server Start**
```bash
cd ai-backend
source ../venv/bin/activate  
python3 server.py
```
