# 🚀 Ready to Test - Simplified Multi-Agent Architecture

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### **Architecture Simplified: 6 → 3 Agents**
```
🗑️ REMOVED (moved to deprecated/):
   ├── customer_agent.py
   ├── product_agent.py  
   ├── order_agent.py
   └── shipping_agent.py

✅ ACTIVE AGENTS:
   ├── unified_business_agent.py    (handles all business operations)
   ├── rules_agent.py              (strategy engine + business rules)
   └── base_agent.py               (foundation class)

🔧 ORCHESTRATION:
   └── dynamic_orchestrator.py     (strategy-driven workflows)
```

## 🎯 Key Test Queries

### **1. Your Main Use Case - Address Change Strategy**
```bash
"I want to change my delivery address but my iPhone 15 Pro order was already shipped. Can you change it to Oak Street Tree Apartment?"
```
**Expected:** Strategy engine selects "Cancel and Reorder with Gift Card"

### **2. Smart Address Completion**
```bash
"Place order for iPhone 15 Pro to Oak Street Tree Apartment address, possible to get in 2 days?"
```
**Expected:** Detects partial address, asks for missing details

### **3. Standard Order Flow**
```bash
"I want to buy an iPhone 15 Pro with express shipping to my home address"
```
**Expected:** Complete order workflow with unified agent

## 🔧 How to Test

### **Option 1: Start the Server**
```bash
cd /Users/sivapolisetty/vscode-workspace/ai-mode-playground/step-3-multi-agent
./setup.sh start
```

### **Option 2: Quick API Test**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I want to change my delivery address but my order was shipped",
    "context": {"customer_email": "john@example.com"}
  }'
```

### **Option 3: Test Script**
```bash
python3 demo/test_simplified_architecture.py
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ **Simplified Agent Structure:**
```
# In logs, you should see:
"Simplified agent structure registered successfully"
"UnifiedBusinessAgent: 15 capabilities"
"RulesAgent: 5 capabilities"

# Instead of the old:
❌ "CustomerAgent registered"  
❌ "ProductAgent registered"
❌ "OrderAgent registered"
❌ "ShippingAgent registered"
```

### ✅ **Strategy Engine Working:**
```
# For shipped orders:
"Selected strategy: Cancel and Reorder with Gift Card"
"Gift card created for $999.99"

# For recent orders:
"Selected strategy: Standard Address Change"
"Order updated with new address"
```

### ✅ **Address Intelligence:**
```
"Extracted address: Oak Street Tree Apartment"
"Address needs completion: true"
"Missing fields: city, state, zip, unit"
```

## 🎛️ Debug Information

### **Agent Activity Logs:**
- `unified_business_agent` handling all business operations
- `rules_agent` doing strategy evaluation  
- `dynamic_orchestrator` executing workflows

### **Performance Indicators:**
- Fewer inter-agent calls
- Faster response times
- Simplified error traces

## 📊 Success Criteria

### ✅ **Functionality Preserved:**
- [ ] Product search works
- [ ] Customer authentication works
- [ ] Order creation works
- [ ] Address handling works
- [ ] Shipping calculations work

### ✅ **Strategy Engine Active:**
- [ ] Different responses for shipped vs recent orders
- [ ] "Cancel and reorder" scenario works
- [ ] Address completion asks for missing details

### ✅ **Architecture Simplified:**
- [ ] Only 3 agents in logs (not 6)
- [ ] No errors about missing agents
- [ ] UnifiedBusinessAgent handles multiple operations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If you see errors about missing agents:**
```bash
# Check that deprecated agents aren't being imported
grep -r "from.*customer_agent\|from.*product_agent" ai-backend/src/
```

### **If strategy engine isn't working:**
```bash
# Check business strategies file exists
ls -la knowledge/business_strategies.json
```

### **If address completion isn't working:**
```bash
# Check MCP tools are working
grep -r "extract_address_from_text" ai-backend/src/
```

## 🎉 Expected Results

### **Your Address Change Use Case:**
```
User: "Change delivery address but order shipped"

Response: "I can help you with that! Since your order has already 
shipped, I'll cancel it and issue a gift card for the full amount 
($999.99). Then I'll create a new order with your desired delivery 
address and apply the gift card as payment."
```

### **Performance Improvement:**
- **50% fewer agents** in logs
- **Faster response times**
- **Cleaner debug traces**
- **Same functionality**

✅ **50% complexity reduction** (6 → 3 agents)  
✅ **Strategy-driven workflows** (no hard-coded limitations)
✅ **Smart address handling** (Oak Street Tree Apartment)
✅ **Product owner control** (edit JSON, no code changes)
